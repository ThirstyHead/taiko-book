# Taiko Book

This books takes a very practical, code-first approach to solving common problems using Taiko, a browser-automation DSL.


## Building the book
This book was written in Asciidoctor. This project assumes that you have Asciidoctor installed locally, as well as Asciidoctor PDF.

### Software Requirements
* Asciidoctor: https://asciidoctor.org
* Asciidoctor PDF: https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoctor-pdf

### Future Features
The default local installation of Asciidoctor is written in Ruby. There is a JavaScript port of Asciidoctor that should run equivalently in NodeJS. Migrating this project to AsciidoctorJS is an early goal of this project so that you can `git clone; npm install; npm build`.
