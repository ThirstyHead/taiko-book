Taiko Feature Requests


## Load a Profile
I would like to describe a "profile" in a JSON file and a command-line flag to load it.

taiko --load-profile=iphone7

ALSO: loadProfile('path/to/profile.json')

The profile would include:
* emulateDevice
* emulateNetwork
* emulateTimezone
* setLocation
* setViewPort
* setConfig
* setCookie
* overridePermissions

Also (not currently supported in Taiko, but available in https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/tot/Emulation/, so technically available via taiko.client)
* setTouchEmulationEnabled
* setUserAgentOverride
* resetPageScaleFactor
* setCPUThrottlingRate
* setEmitTouchEventsForMouse
* setPageScaleFactor
* setNavigatorOverrides
* setVisibleSize

ANSWER: search taiko envirnoment variables





## Screen Zoom
There doesn't appears to be a way in Taiko to zoom in the screen (like a two-finger stretch on a smartphone). 

This would be helpful for emulating a smartphone user. It would also aid in screen recordings for the Taiko book/website.

Is there a chrome flag for zoom? --set-zoom-level or something...




## Make chrome command-line flags pass-thru from Taiko
Can Chrome command-line flags (--window-position, --window-size) be passed to Taiko at the command line and then passed-through to Chrome?

taiko --observe --window-position --window-size

SOLUTION: TAIKO_BROWSER_ARGS







## Ship Taiko with self-signed cert
Every time Taiko invokes the included Chromium, an "accept/deny incoming network requests" dialog appears on MacOS. If Taiko includes a self-signed certificate, the end user can "accept" the cert and suppress the dialog.

See macos-permissions.txt for details.
