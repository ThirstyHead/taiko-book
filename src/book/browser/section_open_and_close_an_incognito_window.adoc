The Taiko action `openIncognitoWindow` allows you to run your scripts in an Incognito window instead of a standard window. Two arguments are required to open a new Incognito window -- a URL and a window name: `openIncognitoWindow('https://thirstyhead.com/conferenceworks/', {name:'New Incognito Window'})`.

The window name is especially important, because it is required to close an Incognito window: `closeIncognitoWindow('New Incognito Window')`. 

You should probably store the window name in a constant or variable so that you can use it later to close the Incognito window.
