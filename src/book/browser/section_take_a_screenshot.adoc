.`form-before-entry.png` captured using Taiko action `screenshot()`

.`form-after-entry.png` captured using Taiko action `screenshot()`
image::browser/form-after-entry.png[Screenshot of form after data entry]

The ability to capture screenshots at key points in your Taiko script helps illustrate the User Journey you are automating. The `screenshot()` action with no arguments creates a PNG image in the current directory named `Screenshot-1589490638953.png`. The last half of the filename is a timestamp.

You'll almost certainly want to give your screenshot a more descriptive name, like `screenshot({path:'form-before-entry.png'})` or `screenshot({path:'form-after-entry.png'})`. In this example, we are capturing a screenshot of an HTML form before data entry begins, and then another screenshot after data entry is complete.
