[[img_click_a_link]]
.`click` emulates a user clicking on a link like `Register`, or tabbing to it and pressing `Enter`.

Using the `click(SELECTOR)` action emulates the user clicking on the selected element. You can also use the `goBack` and `goForward` actions to emulate the user clicking on the `Back` and `Forward` browser buttons.

[NOTE]
====
Taiko has a sophisticated Smart Selector algorithm that allows you to interact with the web page just like a user would by using _what the user sees on screen_ rather than _what the web developer sees from a source code perspective_. While you can use detailed CSS or XPath selectors, that can lead to brittle tests if the underlying source code changes without changing the visible user experience. 

For example, while `click('Register')` and `click($('body > main > p:nth-child(2) > a'))` are both functionally equivalent, the former is more readable, better represents the user's interaction with the web page, and ultimately will be more maintainable over time.

==== Semantic and Proximity Selectors

`click(SELECTOR)` eagerly matches the first item on the page. If you have multiple elements on the page -- all with 'Register' as a visual indicator -- the first thing you should do is re-evaluate your design. After that, you can refine your selector with semantic selectors like `click(link('Register'))` or `click(button('Register'))`. 

Here's a list of semantic selectors:

* button
* checkBox
* color
* dropDown
* fileField
* image
* link
* listItem
* radioButton
* range
* tableCell
* text
* textBox
* timeField

Taiko also provides proximity selectors, like `toRightOf` and `below`. Here's a list of proximity selectors:

* above
* below
* toLeftOf
* toRightOf
* near

`click('Register')` and `click(link('Register', toLeftOf(text('now before this event sells out'))))` are functionally equivalent.
