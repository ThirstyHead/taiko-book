.Taiko actions `openTab` and `closeTab` allow you to open and close new browser tabs.
image::browser/section_open_and_close_a_tab.png[A browser with two open tabs.]

As your app grows in complexity, your user might need to have multiple browser tabs open to accomplish certain tasks. The Taiko actions `openTab` and `closeTab` emulate the user opening and closing new tabs.

By default, `openTab()` opens a new, blank tab. If you'd like to open the tab to a specific URL, simply pass in the URL as an argument: `openTab('https://thirstyhead.com/groceryworks/')`. 

As you begin working with tabs in Taiko, you'll quickly discover that being able to grab and store the `title()` of the tab and the `currentURL()` will be quite helpful. This is especially true when it comes to closing tabs. The Taiko action `closeTab()` closes the current tab, unless you pass in the target tab title `closeTab('GroceryWorks')` or the target tab URL `closeTab('https://thirstyhead.com/groceryworks/')`.
