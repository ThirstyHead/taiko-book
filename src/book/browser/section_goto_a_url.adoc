.`goto(URL)` visits the URL, just like a user typing the URL into the address bar.

Once you have a browser window open, you'll almost certainly want to visit a website by using the `goto(URL)` action. This action returns a `value` object that contains the `url` you visited, as well as a `status` object that represents the HTTP response from the website. 

The `goto(URL)` action accepts any partial URL fragment that the underlying browser does. For example, if you type `goto('thirstyhead.com/conferenceworks')`, notice that three separate HTTP GET requests are sent:

. The first HTTP response is a `301` redirect to upgrade the request from an unsecure `http` address to a secure `https` one. 
. The second HTTP response is another `301` redirect, this time to include the trailing `/` in the URL (indicating that `conferenceworks` is a directory instead of a file).
. The third HTTP response is a `200`, showing us the final successful HTTP request for the implicit `index.html` file in the `/conferenceworks/` directory. 

[source, javascript]
.`goto(URL)` accepts URL fragments and follows HTTP redirects.

NOTE: This series of `HTTP` redirects is the normal behavior of the Chromium browser, and of all browsers in general.
