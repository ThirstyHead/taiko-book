== Introduction

Taiko is a JavaScript-based Domain Specific Language (DSL) for automatically driving your web browser just like a typical user does. If a user goes to your website, clicks on a link, fills in some form fields, and clicks the "submit" button, you can script up that behavior in Taiko and replay it in a reliable, automated way.
