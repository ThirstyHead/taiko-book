If you find yourself having to use more complex selectors, once again, you should use that  as an opportunity to re-evaluate and simplify your design.

For example, well-written, semantically correct, accessible HTML form fields link the `&lt; label&gt;` to the `&lt;input&gt;` using the `for` attribute of the `&lt;label&gt;` and the  `id` of the `&lt;input&gt;`.
