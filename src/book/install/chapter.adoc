== Installation and Configuration

Installing Taiko couldn't be easier. It's a single command: `npm install -g taiko`. But there's plenty more that you can do to configure and customize Taiko once it's installed.

When you install Taiko, notice that you get a known-compatible version of Chromium installed as well. Chromium is an open-source, bare-bones web browser that, as you might've guessed by the name, is the core of the Google Chrome browser. Interestingly, Chromium is also the foundation of the Opera browser, the Microsoft Edge browser, and many others. Chromium-based browsers make up roughly two-thirds of the browser market, so using Chromium with Taiko covers the widest possible swath of web users.
